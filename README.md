# Slack hider
 [Install the chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slack-hider/ojfkenmmieminleikclgocedgpggeecp) so you can use slack in a calmer, more intentional way. 
 
 This adds a button to slack that lets you hide your slack "inbox" so you can focus. While messages are hidden, you can still use the top search bar to jump to specific channels or conversations, but the red alert badges won't appear.Since it's a browser extension, it only works if you use slack's web app.

# Inspiration
This was originally forked from [quiet-slack](https://github.com/tavva/quiet-slack) and then I made a bunch of updates.

I also love, and recommend, other zen-inducing chrome extensions like:
1. [News Feed Eradicator](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator) for Facebook
2. [Inbox When Ready](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inbox-when-ready-for-gmai/cdedhgmbfjhobfnphaoihdfmnjidcpim?hl=en) for Gmail
3. [Distraction Free](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en) for Youtube
4. [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) for ad blocking
