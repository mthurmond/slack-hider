# Overview
 Hide your slacks so you can focus. Slack Hider is a chrome extension so you'll have to use the web app, not the desktop app, for it to work. 
 
 While your messages are hidden, you can still use the top search bar to jump to specific channels or conversations, but the alerts on the left of the screen won't appear, so you'll be using slack in a calmer, more intentional way. 

 When you're ready to see your messages again, just click the button and they're back.

# Inspiration
This was originally forked from [quiet-slack](https://github.com/tavva/quiet-slack) and then I made a bunch of updates.

I also love, and recommend, other zen-inducing chrome extensions like Facebook Newsfeed Eradicator, Distraction Free Youtube, and Inbox When Ready.
