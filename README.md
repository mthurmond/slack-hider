# Slack hider
## Overview
[Install the chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slack-hider/ojfkenmmieminleikclgocedgpggeecp) so you can use slack in a calmer, more intentional way. 
 
The extension adds a button to slack that lets you hide your messages. While messages are hidden, you can still use the top search bar to jump to specific channels or conversations, but the red alert badges won't appear. Since this is a browser extension, it only works if you use slack's web app.

This was originally forked from [quiet-slack](https://github.com/tavva/quiet-slack) and then I made a bunch of updates.
